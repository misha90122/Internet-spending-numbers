Python Installation:

1. Go to the official Python website at https://www.python.org/.
2. Click on the "Downloads" button.
3. Select the latest stable version of Python for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
4. Download the executable file for Python installation.
5. Run the executable file and follow the Python installer's instructions.
6. Install Python with the default settings. You may also be prompted to add Python to your system's PATH variable, which provides convenient access to Python from any folder in the command line (terminal).

Installing the openpyxl Library:

1. After installing Python, open the command prompt (for Windows) or terminal (for macOS and Linux).
2. Enter the command `pip install openpyxl` or `pip3 install openpyxl` (for Linux and macOS) to install the openpyxl library. This library allows your program to interact with Excel files.

Preparing the File for Comparison:

1. Make sure you have an Excel file that contains expenses for two months.
2. Save this file in the same folder as the script `compare_and_record_expenses.py`.

Editing the File Path:

1. Open the `compare_and_record_expenses.py` script in a text editor (e.g., Notepad).
2. Find the line `file_path = "output_file.xlsx"`.
3. Replace `"output_file.xlsx"` with the full path to your Excel file that you want to compare. For example: `"C:\\Users\\YourUsername\\Documents\\expenses.xlsx"` for Windows or `"/home/YourUsername/Documents/expenses.xlsx"` for Linux and macOS.

Running the Program:

1. Save the changes in the script and close the text editor.
2. Open the command prompt (terminal) and navigate to the folder where `compare_and_record_expenses.py` and your Excel file are located.
3. Execute the script with the command: `python compare_and_record_expenses.py` (or `python3 compare_and_record_expenses.py` for Linux and macOS).
4. The script will compare expenses for two months and save the results in the fourth column of your Excel file.

By following these steps, you will be able to successfully use the program to compare expenses in your Excel file.
